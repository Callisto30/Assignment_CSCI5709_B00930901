## References

The code for this project was inspired by the work of SL0TR. I have taken references from their code in my project. You can find their code on CodePen at the following link: SL0TR CodePen.

SL0TR's techniques and image gradient design greatly influenced the visual aspect of my web page. Their creative use of colors and gradients helped in enhancing the overall aesthetics of the website. By studying their code, I gained insights into implementing smooth transitions, responsive layouts, and attractive visual elements.
Specifically, I incorporated SL0TR's approach to:

•	Styling buttons and navigation elements for a modern and visually appealing look.
•	Applying gradients and color schemes that create a visually engaging movie details section.
•	Utilizing icons from the Material Icons library to enhance the user interface.
•	Designing a clean and intuitive layout for the booking form.

I would like to acknowledge the contributions and inspiration provided by SL0TR's code, which played a significant role in the development of my project.
